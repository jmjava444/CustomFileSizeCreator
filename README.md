# CustomFileSizeCreator (Alpha Release!)
 Computer application made in Java: Creates a \*.test file of the user's desired size. Useful for testing a new flash drive or hard drive to see the read and write speeds on it.

I utilized the Java swing library and file chooser to make the GUI for it. This application supports multithreading to update the progress bar as the file is being written to disk. I made this project for fun, and thus it has no warranty. Use at your own risk, and I would appreciate any feedback that you give.

## How To:
Navigate to *CustomFileSizeCreator\out\artifacts\custom_file_size_creator_jar* and open the .jar file to run the application. It is portable, so no need for installation. This application has been tested on Windows, however it should run on Mac and Linux if you have the updated version of Java installed on your PC.
